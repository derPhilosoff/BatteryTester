This app was coded during a student research project and is meant to record the audiodata of a falling primary cell type AA on a solid surface, measure the time between the first three impacts and calculate a factor, that describes how much lower the time between the second and third impact was compared to the first and second one. Based on the research of a prior student research project, this factor can be directly linked to the charge of the primary cell.
Unfortunately, at the moment the measurement between impacts is not precise enough, to get realistic results.
App will be improved in the future by changing the measurement and analysis processes from real-time analysis of the audiostream to first recording the audio, saving it as a file (type not yet clear) and analyzing the data afterwards.
